# emotions_image_classifier
This project is an image classification system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of happy and sad people. Built entirely on Kaggle using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, the model was trained on a custom dataset that was cleaned using OpenCV techniques for blur detection and face filtering. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification, and uses sigmoid activation for binary output. The model demonstrates high accuracy and generalization, making it effective for real-world emotion detection in images. It has also been tested on external images downloaded from the internet, and predictions are made with minimal preprocessing. This repository includes the training notebook, model file, and sample code for testing, and serves as a simple and practical end-to-end deep learning pipeline for beginners interested in computer vision and emotion recognition.
